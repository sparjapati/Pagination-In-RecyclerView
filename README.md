# Pagination-In-RecyclerView

This project helps how to implement pagination in RecyclerView

> In Android, Pagination is a very common feature for heavy-data apps today. It’s also called endless scrolling or infinite scrolling. You want to fetch all data of feed at once and bind with the view, which could time-consuming and your app will appear as running slow. Pagination is used for better user experience and resource management. It has broken down a list of content into equal smaller pieces, loaded one at a time.
